# HiveFund

HiveFund is an AI-powered crowdfunding platform designed to improve trust, transparency, and security in online fundraising. It helps individuals and organizations raise funds for social causes, startups, emergencies, and community projects while reducing fraud and misuse.

##  Features

* **AI-Based Campaign Verification**
  Machine learning models analyze campaign content, documents, and metadata to assess authenticity and credibility.

* **Trust Scoring System**
  Each campaign receives a trust score based on risk indicators, historical behavior, and content analysis. High-trust campaigns gain better visibility.

* **Fraud Detection**
  AI continuously monitors user activity and transactions to detect abnormal patterns such as fake engagement, duplicate campaigns, or coordinated misuse.

* **Admin Review Dashboard**
  Administrators can review AI insights before approving or rejecting campaigns, combining automation with human oversight.

* **Secure Payments**
  Integrated payment gateway for safe and seamless donations.

* **User-Friendly Interface**
  Simple campaign creation, transparent donation tracking, and clear trust indicators for donors.
